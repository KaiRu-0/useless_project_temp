### Project Description
Crackroom is an automated Google Classroom assistant that handles your assignments using AI. It connects to your Google Classroom account, reads assignments, and generates high-quality responses using Gemini 1.5.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Poor college students are drowning in mundane assignments that don't require creativity or critical thinking. Writing a paragraph about cosine similarity? Really? We need these chores out of sight and out of mind!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Enter Crackroom - your AI-powered homework buddy that turns those boring assignments into a thing of the past! It reads your assignments, understands them (probably better than you), and crafts responses that would make your professor proud (or suspicious). Now you can spend that saved hour doing equally unproductive things, but stress-free!
