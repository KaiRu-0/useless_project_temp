### Project Description
Crackroom is an automated Google Classroom assistant that handles your assignments using AI. It connects to your Google Classroom account, reads assignments, and generates high-quality responses using Gemini 1.5.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Poor college students are drowning in mundane assignments that don't require creativity or critical thinking. Writing a paragraph about cosine similarity? Really? We need these chores out of sight and out of mind!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Enter Crackroom - your AI-powered homework buddy that turns those boring assignments into a thing of the past! It reads your assignments, understands them (probably better than you), and crafts responses that would make your professor proud (or suspicious). Now you can spend that saved hour doing equally unproductive things, but stress-free!

#### Important Note üìù
> üö® **Attention Future CrackRoom Enthusiasts!**  
> To run CrackRoom properly, you'll need an actual Google Cloud API key for Google Classroom, which you can obtain from the *legendary* [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). Our backend cannot be hosted yet because we lack the financial resources (any angel investors out there?), and the user tokens have a habit of expiring. So, every now and then, you‚Äôll have to log in again.  
> **TL;DR:** To get the *full, exhilarating* CrackRoom experience, please run it locally with your own Google Cloud and Gemini API keys. Thank you for your patience :) üòÖ
